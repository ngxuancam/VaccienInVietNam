# VaccienInVietNam

The project was made for the contest in HCM Devfest 2021.

## Getting Started

Inspired by the website of the Ministry of Health, we have created an application that allows users to see if there is a preliminary assessment of vaccines in Vietnam.

## List of features
1. Show the number of people injected in the last 10 days.
2. Show the general of Vaccination Statistics.

## API
1. From https://tiemchungcovid19.gov.vn/
  - - [General of Vaccine in Viet Nam](https://tiemchungcovid19.gov.vn/api/public/dashboard/vaccination-statistics/get-detail-latest)
  - - [List the last 30 days about number of people injected by day](https://tiemchungcovid19.gov.vn/api/public/dashboard/injection-statistics/by-days)
  - We tried our best to deal with xml api so it took a lot of time ^^.
